# Open Resources

In the name of collaboration, and with so many of requests of having one stop shop for open resources, this page serves as a starter
and motivation for others to contribute their resources as well. Feel free to submit a PR and add your resources, but also Fork if you have a similar project you want to start at your organization or school.
